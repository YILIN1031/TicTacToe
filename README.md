# TicTacToe
Nice to meet you! Here is Tic Tac Toe, a simple exercise of Shell Scripting. 

> Open a terminal to run this file. About some errors, like `command not found` or `tic_tac_toe.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected`, Please confirm what Unix Shell you are using now, for me `bash tic_tac_toe.sh` is good to run in WSL2, Ubuntu. Anyway, try Google for your question.
