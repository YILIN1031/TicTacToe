# TicTacToe
Nice to meet you! Here is Tic Tac Toe, a simple exercise of Shell Scripting. 

> Open a terminal to run this file. About some error, like `command not found` or `tic_tac_toe.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected`, Please make sure what shell you are using, for me `bash tic_tac_toe.sh` is good to run in WSL2, Ubuntu. Anyway, just Googling.
