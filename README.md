# TicTacToe
Here is Tic Tac Toe, a simple exercise of Shell Scripting. 

> About some errors, like `command not found` or `tic_tac_toe.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected`, Please confirm what Unix Shell you are using now, input `echo $SHELL` in your terminal. `bash tic_tac_toe.sh` is good to run in WSL2, Ubuntu.
